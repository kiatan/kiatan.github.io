    <p>I experienced Japanese calligraphy (shodo) for the first time last Saturday.</p>

<p>I like writing by hand but up until now, I haven’t held a real calligraphy brush so I was excited to join this workshop. Both my friend Yoshiki-san and I wanted to do a new year-ish activity so we thought it would be nice to do Kakizome, the Japanese term for the first writing of the year. Yoshiki-san kindly invited me to this workshop and he registered online for both of us.</p>

<h1 id="workshop-day">Workshop Day</h1>

<p>We wanted to eat lunch together before the workshop so we met at Azabujuban Station around an hour before. We ate at a nearby cafe, with a pretty good vibe I liked. The matcha that I ordered tasted better than the one I make at home so I savored it well. As usual, it was fun chatting with Yoshiki-san.</p>

<p>We walked a bit and we reached a place called エナジーテラスSunnyGo!. It had an art gallery in an underground room roughly as small as my apartment. Though it was small, the atmosphere was lively and colorful, making the cafe I visited earlier pales in comparison. That’s mostly because of the calligrapher’s vibrant art pieces hung all over the place.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-01-26-first-shodo/展示.jpg" alt="Exhibit" /></p>

<h1 id="the-calligrapher">The Calligrapher</h1>

<p>The calligrapher’s name is Kisen Kuzuya. Based on what I saw in the art gallery, there’s no doubt that Kisen-san is highly-skilled and passionate about Japanese calligraphy (shodo). She said that apart from her main job at an IT company, she makes time to do shodo, explaining that it is not a “side job” but rather a “double job.” (In Japanese, the word for side job is 副業 or fukugyo. Changing the first Kanji or Chinese character to 複, the meaning changes to “multiple jobs” while retaining the reading. Nice wordplay, right?)</p>

<p>I was deeply moved by that explanation. Kisen-san knowing what she wants and actually doing it inspired me a lot.</p>

<h1 id="shodo-experience">Shodo Experience</h1>

<p>As I said above, I had no prior experience with shodo. So naturally, I was nervous at first. Thankfully, Kisen-san explained the process starting from the basic things, such as explaining the tools used for shodo, how to dip the brush, etc.</p>

<p>It felt nice when I started writing. I fell in love with the feeling of painting the Kanji on the special calligraphy paper. It’s my first time so the character that I wrote was out of balance and kind of looked bad. Kisen-san kindly taught me how to improve it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-01-26-first-shodo/希望.jpg" alt="Learning shodo" /></p>

<p>One example that I remember is when she taught me that one part of the word for “hope” needed to be curved and not straight as I wrote it to be.</p>

<p>Although it was my first time, the creative part of my brain was definitely stimulated. I love the feeling of being creative.</p>

<h1 id="a-special-present">A Special Present</h1>

<p>Before the workshop ended, Kisen-san reminded us that the workshop admission that we had included a present from her. That is, a kanji which Kisen-san thinks represents the participant written by herself on a small card. When Kisen-san was about to write the kanji, all three of us gathered around her. At first, she chose to write the kanji for me first. We tried to guess what she was about to write. When she started writing, the room filled with our oohs and ahhs as we were amazed by her technique.</p>

<p>The Kanji for me was “楽”, which can mean fun or ease. I enjoy my life, so I think it suits me well. And recently, I wanted to feel at ease, so it’s perfect. Yoshiki’s was was “繋”, meaning to connect. The reason is that Yoshiki-san often contacted Kisen-san before this event was held.</p>

<p>We took a picture with Kisen-san, holding our presents.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-01-26-first-shodo/プレゼント.jpg" alt="Our present" /></p>

<p>Kisen’s kanji is truly a work of art. I couldn’t wait to decorate my home with this.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed experiencing Japanese culture such as shodo. Thanks to the calligrapher Kisen-san’s bubbly personality, we also felt cheerful. I learned many things about shodo, making me want to write more kanji characters in the future.</p>
