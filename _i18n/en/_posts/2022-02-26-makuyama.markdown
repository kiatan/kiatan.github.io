I hiked with my girl friends in Mt. Maku for an early spring!

# Start

I want to hike at least once a month so I searched on Google for hiking recommendations for early February. One of the Google Search results showed some hiking recommendations where you can do “hanami 花見,” the Japanese word for watching flowers. Because of that, I included “hanami” in my array of usual Google Search keywords: “hiking”, “day-trip”, “beginner,” plus “hanami”. This article came up in one of the first few results.

I skimmed the article and thought that the flowers in the pictures were beautiful. My favorite color is pink so my choices were cherry blossoms, peach blossoms, or plum blossoms. It was not time for cherry and peach, so I went with plum blossoms. In the article, Mt. Maku in Yugawara town has one of the earliest viewing periods so I chose that. According to the article, the plum blossoms are ready for viewing starting early February to mid-March, which is just in time. At first, I scheduled the hike to be on the 12th of February, but due to a previous appointment, I rescheduled it to the next week. However, it rained that day so I ended up going on the 26th.

# The Participants

This time, I invited two friends. Let me briefly introduce them.

## Lai

Lai from Malaysia came to Japan at the same time as me to work in the same company. She is one of my best friends in Japan whom I hiked with the most.

## Hina

Hina is one of my first few Japanese friends. We went to a badminton event last month and I thought that it was fun to be active with her and she told me that she likes hiking so I invited her to join.

I am the organizer for this hike so it was my responsibility to introduce them to each other. I didn’t know the Japanese word for the person who introduces her friends to each other, so I asked my language partner during our language exchange before leaving for the hike. He said that I can use the word is “kanji 幹事.” In other words, I am the “kanji” of this trip.

We took this selfie inside the train.

I made a rough draft of the plan for the hike and sent it to both Hina and Lai via SNS. It looked like something like this:

> Hey, I made a rough plan,  lemme know what you think!
> 
> 
> 7:45 Depart from Kawasaki Station via the Tokyo-Ueno Line
> 
> 7:45-9 Go to Yugawara Station
> 
> 9~ Convenience store,  toilet break, etc
> 
> 9:30 Go to Mt. Maku via bus
> 
> 10 Slowly start hiking
> 
> 12 Do a lunch picnic somewhere in the mountain
> 
> 14 Finish hiking
> 

# Departure from Kawasaki Station

The three of us met in Kawasaki Station as planned. I introduced Lai and Hina to each other. Both of them speak fluently enough Japanese and English so it was fine since there is no language barrier. We departed using the Ueno-Tokyo Line. We chatted about several different topics and thought my two friends can get along with each other.

We were headed towards the direction of Mt. Fuji so we were able to see it huge.

The train line ran along the sea so we were able to see its beauty.

As planned, we purchased picnic goods from the convenience store right in front of the station. We were all hungry so each one of us ate an onigiri (Japanese word for “rice ball”).

According to Google Maps, we were supposed to use a bus to go towards Mt. Maku. However, the schedule written on the app was a bit different from the actual one. We figured it out because a lady was announcing the bus departures to Mt. Maku via a megaphone. There is probably a special schedule today as there is an ongoing event in Mt. Maku called the 梅の宴, or the banquet of the plum.

While we were on the bus, I realized that I forgot a very important matter to ask my friends. “You don’t have hayfever, right?” Thankfully, both of them said no. I told myself that as an event planner/organizer, I should take into account this kind of detail. Next time I will try to bear in my mind.

During the bus ride, I introduced the recently popular word game, Wordle, to Hina. I already exchanged Wordle results with Lai every day so there was no need to introduce it to her. I thought that because Hina is interested in English, she would enjoy Wordle. I explained the game rules to her and she started guessing the word of the day. If you’re interested in Wordle, you can play it here (I have Japanese readers, okay?)

# Hiking

The bus arrived at Mt. Maku Park, which is located at the foot of the mountain. There was an entrance fee so we lined up and purchased the entrance ticket. The sign at the entrance says that the flowers were only 70% in bloom. Too bad, I thought. But I remembered that I was supposed to go here two weeks ago... and if I did, I probably wouldn’t haven’t seen a single flower, so I guess I could still call myself lucky.

We were greeted by the pink scenery as we entered the park. Because of the ongoing event, it was more crowded than I expected. There was a bazaar as well. We could have bought our picnic food there, but too bad we already had our convenience store food.

We approached the foot of the mountain and started hiking. The plum grove was beautiful. I smelled the sweet aroma of the plum blossoms. “Wow it smells so good,” I exclaimed to my friends. However, both of them said they did not smell anything. Ahem?

As we continued walking, we warmed up, basking in the sweltering sunlight. Winter was about to end so it was starting to get warm, I thought. I stripped my warm layers one by one until I was just wearing my shirt.

We continued walking by just following the path without looking at the map. As we proceeded, the plum trees got fewer and fewer. Huh, that’s strange, I thought, so I checked with my hiking app. “Oh, sh*t, we’re going clockwise” (re: the hiking course was circular and the guide stated that we should go counterclockwise.) I apologized to my friends and asked them whether we should continue or go back. They said it was okay to continue so we did.

I saw this small shrine at the entrance of the forest. 

We entered a forest of just camphor trees and took another selfie.

Like I said earlier, it was quite warm today so it felt good to be under the cool shade of the forest.

While hiking, Hina exclaimed “oh I have a Wordle guess” and I found it funny, good to know she’s enjoying the game I introduced to her.

As we continued climbing the forest, the ground started getting muddy. It was slippery and dangerous so we had to be careful. After a few minutes of walking, I realized the reason for the muddiness. We began seeing splotches of thin ice on the ground. That’s when it clicked to me. I saw that this mountain was covered in snow a few days ago on Instagram. So all this mud is probably due to melted snow.

Sign for the mountain summit.

We finally arrived at the top of the mountain. There were many people doing picnic, and we joined them. We set up the picnic mat that I prepared on top of the grass and sat on it. We enjoyed the food that we bought from the convenience store.

We noticed that our shoes and pants were so dirty because of the muddy trail.

While eating, Hina finally solved the Wordle of the day.

After eating, we enjoyed the view of Sagami Bay from the top of the mountain. It was nice.

We started going down the mountain and it was naturally easier because of gravity.

We saw a huge boulder on the way down, and apparently, people use it for rock climbing. I got excited just by looking at it. Unfortunately, I was not able to try it because I didn’t prepare. Adventurous activities thrill me so I’ll definitely try this kind of rock climbing next time.

We walked for a bit and we finally arrived back at the plum grove. There were thousands of flowers and it was the definition of a pink forest. I took several pictures using the camera that I brought. Here are some of them.

Because there were thousands of them, the fragrance of the plum blossoms was so perceivable. Hina said she was finally able to smell it. The ambrosial fragrance made it seem like we were in paradise. Lai said she still could not smell it. I found it funny that she did not smell any plum blossom during the whole hike. Too bad, I thought.

# Going Home

We used Tokyo-Ueno Line again to go home. We were fairly tired so it was a silent train ride. 

Overall, I thought that it was such a girly hike, and I love it. The mountain was not high, the hiking trail was friendly, and the scenery was so pink so it’s perfect for a girls’ day out, I thought. I had fun introducing my two friends to each other.
