I went to Kamakura for a small retreat from my busy Tokyo life.

# The First Day

These few days, the things I need to do and the things I want to do piled up so my mind is so cluttered, making me feel blue. I knew I was gonna burn up anytime soon if I don’t take a break. I didn’t wanna burn out so, to re-organize my thoughts and refresh my mind, I applied for some of my paid leaves.

This time, I decided to go to Kamakura, which I’ve already visited in the past. I usually want to visit places where I haven’t visited but let me tell you why I chose Kamakura. There are three main reasons. First, Kamakura’s location is not that far from where I live. It just takes an hour to go there. This trip is quite abrupt so I didn’t wanna spend much money so I decided to save on transportation expenses. Second, I chose Kamakura for its vibe. It seems to be a very peaceful place with plenty of temples. It being spiritual suits my current situation, I thought. I’m not a religious person but I like the idea of cleansing one’s soul. The third reason is that Kamakura is situated near the sea. I don’t see seas often so I wanted to go to one.

I finally arrived at Kamakura. I kept my earphones away so I can keep my mind distraction-free

After getting out of Kita-Kamakura station, I saw my first temple of the day, Engakuji. 

(By the way, “ji” or “tera” or “dera” means “temple” in Japanese. I feel iffy typing “Engakuji Temple” even though that’s probably the official(?) English translation, because it literally means Engaku-temple Temple)

The entrance had a fee so I decided not to go in and just look from the outside.

I walked towards my next stopover, Kenchoji, following the signs.

The hiking course that I planned to take was inside Kenchoji so I had no choice but to enter it, even though it was paid. The temple ground was pretty vast. However, because it was a weekday, there were only very few people.

Following the map, I stumbled upon this remarkably long path. This scene feels like a gate to heaven.

I saw a few caves while walking. Although I wasn’t sure if I could enter them, they made me excited as they reminded me of my favorite game, Tomb Raider.

I was so intrigued by these statues. I didn’t know what they are but they remind me of angels from Christianity(?) because of their wings. Their whole composition made me feel like they were a mixture of Japan’s tradition and Western. Upon checking on Google, I found out that they were tengu, supernatural beings in Japanese folklore.

I arrived at the viewing deck of Hansobo, the heart of Kenchoji.

If you look close, you can see the sea from afar. I like the fact that I was able to capture temples, forests, hills, and the sea all in one picture. Isn’t it amazing?

The entrance to the hiking course was somewhat blocked so I thought it was closed. Thankfully, the person from the temple shop called out to me and told me that only parts of the hiking trail were closed. Well, I planned to just do some parts of the trail and head to Kamakura station so I proceeded and she let me enter the trail.

When I started climbing the hiking course, I saw Mt. Fuji’s iconic white top. The sky was not clear so that part looks like it was floating. Can you spot it?

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/14.png)

While I’m hiking, let me tell you why I enjoy it a lot. When I was still in grade school, I used to play Tomb Raider a lot. I wanted to be like the main character in the game, Lara Croft because she is so strong and adventurous. She often went outdoors to hike and camp, etc.

I saw a fellow hiker. Japanese hikers are generally friendly so we greeted each other Konnichiwa!

He told me that he can see Mt. Fuji from where he was standing. I already knew I could see Mt. Fuji but he convinced me to go to where he was standing. I went and realized what he was talking about. Mt. Fuji was placed directly on top of the rock, and it was such a good frame to capture.

## Hiking thoughts


- While I was hiking, I started to take notice of the minute things again. For example, as the wind blew, I heard the sound of the rustling leaves. Noticing small details of nature like this made me feel the beauty of living in the world.
- Hiking is free of distraction, that’s why I like it so much. Being in nature is an escape from the busyness of my city life. I feel refreshed by basking in the green forest. This is the feeling of Shinrin-yoku (a Japanese term for forest bathing). I started having doubts about why I chose to live in such a busy city like Tokyo when I prefer a more laid-back place.
- I feel grateful living in Japan. First, it is very commuter-friendly. I can easily commute to places such as this without needing a car. Second, because it is not a tropical country, I can do physical activities like hiking without suffering from the heat.
- Maybe I also like hiking because it makes me feel closer to death. One wrong step and I could fall and land somewhere inaccessible and no one may know it. So, it means that I could die without anyone knowing. However, I think that being close to death makes me value my life more because I am reminded that I am merely human and not an eternal being. So I want to cherish the time that I have when I'm still alive. It makes me question whether the things I'm doing now are fulfilling my life. Because I only have one life, and after all, I'm a “being towards death”.
- Hiking also makes me feel like I'm in such a huge world because the scenery is so different from my everyday life. And this feeling of being a small entity in an enormous place, such as the world, is not something I feel in my daily life. Suddenly, all my problems and stressors feel so small and insignificant in this huge world. This thought comforts me.
- I've also noticed that there are many older people in this hike. It's just an amazing thing for me that Japanese elder people are still very strong and healthy that they can do hiking.

I passed by this small climb with a rope. Even though it's such a small thing, it excited me a little because it feels a bit more adventurous. It made me wish I could go to a more adventurous place.

I saw this lovely hiking couple. Because I wanted to just relax, and not think about navigating myself, I just followed them. Seeing them made me want to have a partner whom I can hike with, even as we grow old.

Towards the end, there were some bamboo groves.

After finishing my fairly short hiking course, I visited Kakuonji (temple) which is situated near the end of the trail.

While walking towards Kamakura station, I saw these yellow flowers in bloom, called Wintersweet (ろうばい). They look like yellow cherry blossoms.

## Late Lunch

I was hungry when I finished the long hike and walk. As my holiday treat, I went to a fairly highly rated Japanese restaurant.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/24.png)

I ate this and it tasted good.

Here are some other photos I took while walking around Kamakura.

Spring is about to come!

Even the statues are wearing a mask.

## Heading towards my lodging

My hostel is located in Hase Station, a few stations away from Kamakura station via the Enoden line.

I arrived at my hostel and had a great chat with the friendly hostel owner, Hide-san. He had several recommendations for things to do or restaurants to eat at. And that includes going to Hasedera. I already went to some temples in the morning so I was hesitant to go to another one. However, I still went because I didn’t have anything to do anyway. 

## Hasedera

After arriving at the temple grounds and spending a few minutes, I realized that I didn't regret my decision to go. 

In the main hall, the Buddha is not the usual one. It's gold and huge. I wanted to take a picture but sadly it was prohibited to take photos inside the main hall.

This is a statue of Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless Light, in the hall beside the main hall. It is not as big as the main one, but still majestic nonetheless.

I was also intrigued by the small statues surrounding one of the halls of Hasedera. Apparently, they are called Sentai Jizo, which means a thousand Jizo’s. According to the guide, Jizo is a Buddhist deity for protecting children and giving prosperity to one’s descendants.

I haven’t noticed but when I shared this photo to my friend, he noticed that each face was different from each other. Amazing!

I arrived at the top of the temple grounds and approached the viewing deck.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/31.png)

I can see the town and the sea. It was such a spectacular view. While admiring it, I felt solitude too because there were no other people.

I saw some plum blossoms in bloom.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/32.png)

Japanese gardens or temple grounds relaxed me because of wabi-sabi, a form of traditional Japanese beauty which accepts transience and imperfection. I like the concept because it eases my perfectionism, relieving the pressure on things to be perfect. That pressure is lifted as I walk through this garden.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/33.png)

I went to the east of the temple grounds and proceeded to this cave with a tori gate in front. Inside it was so solemn and I felt awe in this very spiritual place.  Few people were praying inside. The temple closed shortly after I exited the cave.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/34.png)

## Dinner

After my visit to Hasedera, almost everything was closed, so I decided to go to the Izakaya (a Japanese bar) recommended by Hide-san called Shamoji. 

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/35.png)

I'm beside the sea, so it's just natural for me to eat seafood. I ordered Misaki maguro (tuna) rice bowl with shirasu (whitebait) toppings. Eating this reminds me of the time I went to Misaki. 

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/36.png)

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/37.png)

The fish was fresh as I expected. And I felt full from my rice bowl. So I decided to walk it off before heading back to my hotel. Without realizing it, I reached Kamakura station.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/38.png)

I walked so much today and I don't want to arrive at my hotel too late at night, so instead of walking, I decided to take the Enoden line train to Hase station again. 

I arrived at my hotel quite tired. But, I maximized my day so I won’t complain.

# The Second Day

I thought that since Kamakura is facing East, where the sun will rise, I wanted to see it for myself. I was picking where I want to greet the sun: at the top of a hike, or by the sea while running. I was already tired last night and I didn’t have the energy to look for a trail anymore, so I decided to just go for a run.

I woke up around 5:30 am. I drank the free coffee provided by the hostel to energize myself for my run.

I went outside when it was still dark and started running along the seaside. I loved the sound of the waves and the fresh air.

I didn’t run seriously, as I was distracted by the beautiful view. I sometimes paused to take videos or photos, which I will dump on this article.

The first stop was Inamuragasaki, a cape not so far from my hostel. I went down to the rocks beside the sea to get a closer view. The waves were roaring as they crashed upon the rocks. I even got showered a bit, which made me laugh. It was so fun yet so calming. I loved the feeling.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/39.png)

As I was running towards Enoshima, the sun finally peeked out, so I observed it and snapped a few pictures. The orange rising sun contrasts well with the blue sea. Its light was even reflected by the sea. I felt like I really am in Japan, as I am in the “land of the rising sun,” haha. The view (and the run) was breathtaking, and I felt so lucky to be able to witness a beautiful scene.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/40.png)

Here are some pictures from my run.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/41.png)

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/42.png)

Enoshima from afar.

I continued running and finally reached Enoshima Ohashi, a bridge towards Enoshima. I wasn’t intending to go to the actual island but I thought since I’m already here, might as well. 

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/43.png)

I ran from the entrance of Enoshima towards the back part, where the Iwaya Cave is. The island was almost empty because it was an early morning of a weekday. 

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/44.png)

I reached the distinct red bridge that leads towards the caves.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/45.png)

However, the cave doesn’t open until 9 am so I wasn’t able to go in. But it’s okay, I went there twice last year anyway.

I ran back towards the nearest Enoden station and went back to my hostel to check out. 

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/46.png)

I started heading home. 

I was hungry so I stopped by Kamakura station for brunch. I ate at a cafe called Garden House. I liked its refreshing vibe. Because I was quite hungry, I ordered a salad to add to my open-faced chicken sandwich.

![](/assets/images/2022-01-28-kamakura-enoshima/47.png)

After that, I went back to Tokyo for real.

The crowd increased as I neared Tokyo. When I finally get off my train, it was pretty crowded. I forgot for a while that Tokyo is a very populated place.  It pricked my heart a bit to be reminded of the busyness of city life. It made me think whether I would rather live in the suburb or provincial place, sacrificing convenience over laid-backness.

As I arrived home, it felt like I was gone for a very long time. I think it means that I made full use of my two days one night holiday. I did many things, and I was alone. Being alone with my thoughts the whole time, helped me hear my intuition/my heart, which I probably neglected recently. That being said, I think my very cluttered brain came home more organized. In a sense, I fulfilled the purpose of taking a paid leave.
