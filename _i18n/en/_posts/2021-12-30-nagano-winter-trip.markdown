I wanted to spend my holidays in a snowy place so I went to Nagano.


### The Day Before

I finished packing my pack the day before. My backpack was pretty big so I also slipped my whole camera bag inside it. I haven't worn the white boots in the picture for two years already so I was excited as I was going to be able to wear them again on this trip.

In other words, I haven't been to a snowy place for two years already. I checked the weather forecast to mentally prepare for that. It seems that it will be freezing so I was a bit nervous.

I will leave at 6 am the next day so I set my alarm to 5 am.

# The First Day

Let's go! It was still dark but I wanted to make full use of the day so I decided to leave early.

![Train](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/一日目-00.jpg)

First of all, I was going to meet with my company for this trip at Ueno Station's Shinkansen (bullet train) platform.

## Riding the Shinkansen from Ueno Station

I was finally able to meet with my friend. We wanted to buy tickets from the ticket sales machine but I used Mobile Suica (IC Card), I could not use it, for the machine only accepts the physical card. So, we ended up buying from the ticket office.

### Introducing my Friend

Name: Bryan Lao

Nickname: Bry

![Bry and I](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/友達の紹介-00.png)

Bry was my instructor for programming in my alma mater, Ateneo. He graduated as a PhD student in NAIST. He moved to Tokyo after that after that to work.

### Chat in the Shinkansen

**Difference between Philippine and Japanese culture**

We both grew up in the Philippines and came to Japan in our 20s. We compared and discussed how it is different to live in the Philippines and Japan and the different points of view which both countries can be looked at.

**Trying out camera lenses**

![Camera](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/カメラレンズ-00.jpg)

Bry is a camera enthusiast so he owns several camera lenses. He lent me one to use with my mirrorless camera, explaining its capabilities and usage.

## Arriving at Nagano Station

Thanks to the Shinkansen, in just a few hours, we arrived at Nagano Station. It's way colder here than in Tokyo.

### I learned about Sugitama

While looking for a place to eat breakfast, Bry called out to me. He pointed to the green sphere hanging from the ceiling, explaining that it is called a Sugitama ("cedar ball", indicating the maturity of sake. Green balls are freshly made sake, which develops into brown balls that are matured sake.

![Sugitama](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/杉玉-00.jpg)

### Breakfast at Kobeya Kitchen

I ordered a hot sandwich set. Traveling is no excuse not to eat veggies so I was glad that my order came with a side salad.

## Heading towards Yudanaka Station

We can choose between riding a bus or a train but the bus makes me nauseous so we decided to take the train.

![Heading towards Yudanaka Station](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中駅に向かう-00.jpg)

I was surprised that I could not use my Suica in this station. So, I bought from the ticket sales machine again (☉｡☉)!

![Ticket](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中駅に向かう-01.jpg)

I thought it was strange that the train floor was wet. And then I realized that it was probably due to all the snow from the passengers' shoes.

I took this picture on my train transfer.

![Train](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中駅に向かう-02.png)

The views we had in our train ride were fields and mountains blanketed by thick snow.

## Arriving at Our Hostel

Our room was a simple traditional Japanese-style room.

![Room](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ホテル-00.jpg)

The outside view was also Japanese style.

![Outside view](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ホテル-01.jpg)

## Lunch

We ate Pork Char siu Ramen at a small Chinese diner behind our hostel. We planned to walk lots so eating something full of carbs was justly appropriate.

![Lunch](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ランチ.jpg)

I got full from this!

## Jigokudani Monkey Park

After lunch, we headed towards Jigokudani Monkey Park, a park where you can see monkeys bathe in onsen (hot spring). We walked on a snow-covered mountain road. There was snow everywhere I looked and everything was so white and pretty.

![Walking](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/地獄谷野猿公苑-00.png)

The road was thickly covered with fresh snow so they were so soft to walk at. It was surprising that there was no one else here, despite being a tourist spot.

![Walking](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/地獄谷野猿公苑-01.jpg)

After walking for so long, we finally arrived at the park.

The monkeys weren't inside the onsen, but rather just sitting or walking around. Maybe because they can access the onsen anytime, they're probably tired of it.

![Monkey park](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/地獄谷野猿公苑-02.png)

After a few minutes, finally one of them entered the onsen, delighting the visitors.

![Monkey](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/地獄谷野猿公苑-03.jpg)

Apart from that, these two monkeys did something funny. Bry said that I was able to take the "perfect picture" lol

![Monkey](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/地獄谷野猿公苑-04.jpg)

We decided to walk back from the monkey park back to our hostel. The ramen I ate was already fully digested so I was hungry again. Luckily, there was a cafe halfway on the way home. The cafe's lighting charmingly contrasts with the winter scenery so I decided to take this picture.

![Cafe](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ココアのお店.jpg)

I ordered hot chocolate, which is perfect for winter, am I right? ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
Because of the warmth that it gave me, I was able to conquer the cold snowy mountain on the way back!

![Cocoa](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ココア.jpg)

## Yudanaka Onsen

The hostel we stayed at was affiliated with an onsen called Yorozuya, so we were able to purchase onsen tickets at a discounted price. We headed to the said onsen, which was just a 5-minute walk from our hostel.

![Yorozuya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中温泉-00.jpg)

![Yorozuya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中温泉-01.jpg)

Two words to describe Yorozuya's interior were elegant and traditional. I love it.

![Yorozuya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中温泉-02.jpg)

![Yorozuya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/湯田中温泉-03.jpg)

I entered the rotenburo ("open-air hot spring bath") and admired the snow surrounding it. It's the second-best onsen experience I had (the first one was when it was actually snowing). My exhausted feet which I used the whole day was revitalized, thanks to the heat of the onsen. Entering the onsen is the best feeling for the tired. 

Bry was this happy.

![Bry in onsen](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip//湯田中温泉-04.jpg)

## Dinner at the Izakaya

It was already late we left the onsen so almost all of the restaurants were already closed. We ended up eating at an Izakaya (Japanese bar).

![Izakaya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/居酒屋-00.jpg)

Bry has an alcohol allergy and I wanted to reduce my alcohol intake so both of us ordered soft drinks only at the Izakaya (lol). I thought it was funny when said cheers over our glasses of orange juice and soda.

![Soft drinks](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/居酒屋-01.jpg)

We ate yakitori. It was so salty, so thank god I ordered orange juice to save my tongue lol

![Yakitori](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/居酒屋-02.jpg)

I haven't tried Yakionigiri (grilled rice ball) so I ordered it as well. I thought its brown color was because of using brown rice, making me amazed how such a healthy menu can be ordered in a bar. However, Bry said that it wasn't brown rice, but rather due to soy sauce. Oops. (；^ω^）

# The Second Day

## Okushiga Kogen Ski Resort

We used this discounted red ticket to go to Okushiga Kogen Ski Resort by bus.

![Bus](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-00.jpg)

The snow-covered mountain is so pretty, right? This is the kind of view that I couldn't see in Tokyo.

![Snow view](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-01.jpg)

We bought ski lift tickets and rented some skis.

![Rental](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-02.jpg)

![Rental](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-03.jpg)

![Map](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-04.jpg)

We rode the lift. Thankfully the weather was good ヽ(･ˇ∀ˇ･ゞ)

![Lift](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/奥志賀高原-05.jpg)

We didn't take ski school or class so we were naturally not good at it. I watched the other skiers and tried to copy them.

I was very scared but I really wanted to try skiing. Once I got off the lift, there was no other way to go down but to ski. I tried to use my earphones to mask my fear. And it worked, the lively music alleviated my fear a bit, encouraging me to go down the slope. In fact, it excited me.

However, I often lost my confidence. I was afraid to fall so I panicked a lot. Because of that panic, my body stiffened, making me end up falling. I can't even count how many times I fell, I just knew it was too much. 

It was quite embarrassing because I'm so bad at it despite being on a beginner slope (^～^;)ゞ. But it's okay, I assured myself. It's only reasonable because everyone is a beginner at first. Anyway, my purpose for skiing was to have fun.

To be fair, I had a lot of fun. Even falling several times was okay because the snow was very soft.

But doing something you're unfamiliar with is tiring, right? What I want to say is skiing fried my brain too (~_~メ)

## Heading towards Shibu Onsen

Using the same ticket, we went down the hill via bus.

![Same ticket](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/渋温泉へ-00.jpg)

## Dinner

Walking a bit from the bus stop, we arrived at a restaurant called Happy Restaurant.

![Happy](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ハッピー-00.jpg)

Finally, some real food here! (Btw, my breakfast was just yogurt and my lunch was just Calorie Mate, a Japanese brand energy bar).
The tonkatsu (pork cutlet) set that I ordered was quite good.

![Tonkatsu](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/ハッピー-01.jpg)

## Kanaguya

We visited Shibu Onsen's Kanaguya on the way home. It is a historical Japanese inn that inspired Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away, they say.

![Kanaguya](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/金具屋-00.jpg)

We started to walk back home from Shibu Onsen. Some snow was already half melted so it was very slippery. We threaded carefully.

While walking, I saw this snow-covered post. Snow and posts are two things I like so I was glad to take this picture. The vivid red post has a beautiful contrast with the muted white snow, right?

# The Last Day

We checked out and headed to Yudanaka Station. From there, we took the train to go to Nagano Station. I wanted to kill time so I read a book.

![Reading a book](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/三日目-00.jpg)

It was lunchtime when we arrived. Bry wanted to eat Shinshu Soba so we ate at a standing soba restaurant at the station. I ordered soba with egg. Note that this was my first time eating at a standing restaurant (人 •͈ᴗ•͈)

![Soba](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/三日目-01.jpg)

It was time for us to ride the bus that we reserved so we headed to the bus stop. We're taking the bus on the way home because we wanted to save. But vacations are supposed to be enjoyed, so we didn't want to cheap out too much. The good compromise would be taking the shinkansen on the way to, and the bus on the way back, we thought.

![Bus](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/三日目-02.png)

I read again inside the bus.

![本を読んでいる](/assets/images/2021-12-30-nagano-winter-trip/三日目-03.png)

After that, I finished writing this report. Overall, these past three days have been a lovely way to spend my vacation. This is the longest time I've walked on snow. As a Filipino, I grew up in a tropical country where there isn't snow so going to a snowy place such as Nagano made me glad.
