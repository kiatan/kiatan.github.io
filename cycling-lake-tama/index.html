    <p>I wanted to hike with my friend, Maru, to see flowers. However, as it is still too early for spring, I decided to ask him out on a cycling trip instead. Two birds in one stone I thought. I get to practice my nearly non-existent cycling skills and I get to spend time with Maru.</p>

<p>Preparation</p>

<p>Because I am the one who initiated this trip, I had to come up with a rough plan. I don’t mind it at all as I love planning and Maru seems to be relatively open to things.</p>

<p>I considered the Tamagawa River (1) cycling route which I found out about while running along said river. The two reasons I did not go with that were 1) I run along Tamagawa around four times a week at this point so I wanted to go somewhere different, 2) there is a long stretch of cherry trees here that haven’t bloomed yet so I decided that cycling here with someone would be better for the next time. So, I googled cycling roads we could go to around Tokyo. The popular ones came out, Edogawa River, Arakawa River, etc. But the thing that caught my eye was the Tama Lake cycling road. The description on Google that sold it to me was something on the lines of “perfect for nature without going too far from the city center.”</p>

<p>Both Maru and I don’t have bicycles but I was rest-assured because I always rent one anyway. However, I found out upon checking out Docomo Bike Share, the app that I use all the time to rent a bike, that there are no renting stations near Tama Lake. So, I had to look up a way to rent a bike, or else we could not go on this trip.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is another mainstream renting service called Hello Cycling. It seems to have a larger scale than Docomo. I downloaded it and found some bicycle stations in Musashi-Sakai Station, the station where we would begin our cycling. I told Maru to install it and he asked me for a coupon code. Apparently, there is an ongoing promo that gives a discount when you invite a friend both you and your friend. Good catch, I thought. Just like that, we were equipped to go on this trip.</p>

<p>I asked Maru where his nearest train station was and I was surprised that he answered the station name and its number. I almost never used station numbers so I found it amusing. Considering where he is coming from, I looked for a station where we could meet on the way to our cycling starting point, Musashi-Sakai Station. Then, I drafted a rough timetable and sent it, together with some pointers to consider, to Maru on the day before the big day.</p>

<p>The Day</p>

<p>Before leaving my house, I had a quick call with my Japanese teacher to practice my speaking. We have a practice every Saturday and I was lucky enough that he was willing to accommodate my fairly early schedule this day. I did not feel like eating so I just drank a cafe latte, thinking the caffeine would energize me.</p>

<p>I arrived at the meeting place, Ochanomizu Station, right on time. Maru was gonna be late, he informed me. I did not mind it at all. But that hasn’t always been the case. Back when I was younger, I despised waiting for late people. I thought it was disrespectful to the person waiting and wasteful of time. Thankfully, as my views on life changed, my reaction and attitude toward waiting for the late person also changed. I now see it pointless to have such a negative reaction over something that could not be controlled. Blaming the late person is also pointless. Being late is not always the late person because of the fact that accidents happen. Sometimes even when the person who is late strives to be on time but is just unfortunate to accidentally miss trains, etc. (2) Besides acknowledging the pointlessness of things and the fact that accidents do happen, I also figured out that the time waiting did not need to be a wasted time. Because people being late can’t be fully avoided, I now use the time waiting to entertain myself, like fiddling with my phone. This time, I had my Kindle reader with me so I used it to read the current book that I was reading, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami.</p>

<p>While waiting, I had my second serving of caffeine. I got my energy “booster,” giving me alertness. Despite just being a bottled coffee from the train station convenience store, it was rather tasty. Good purchase.</p>

<p>Maru and I met on the train platform and rode the next train bound to our destination. Thanks to the caffeine in me, I felt fully awake and fairly talkative. We had a chat about Joe Hisaishi and how good his music is. He likes Spirited Away’s theme and I like Nausicaa. Mostly because it’s catchy. I don’t remember the song names but I can identify them when I hear them.</p>

<p>After some time, we arrived at Musashi-Sakai Station. We bought picnic food at the Queen’s Isetan supermarket right outside the ticket gates. The cashier asked Maru if he wanted an <em>oshibori</em> but he did not understand it so I said yes for him, explaining its meaning after. I guess this kind of word is not something you learn from class but from experience, I thought. As we were putting the sandwiches we bought in our bag, I remembered about the mandarin oranges that I packed in my bag. I was afraid of them being squeezed during our ride, later on, joking that it would turn into orange juice if ever. Maru told me to put it inside a plastic bag provided at the supermarket packing counter so I did.</p>

<p>We walked to the Hello Cycling station “as a warm-up,” I told Maru. Not exactly a lie per se but the true agenda was, that I just wanted to start cycling as near as possible to the cycling road. Yes, that’s right, we had to cycle a bit to reach the technical starting point of the cycling road.</p>

<p>While walking, I mentioned the song Cold Heart to Maru. It was my earworm at the moment and it was just fascinating to me that it is a song sung by both Dua Lipa and Elton John. Yes, the old Elton John. I was thrilled by the fact that Maru knew about Elton John. Not many young people are familiar with the classics, that’s why. Maru has good taste, I thought.</p>

<p>We saw some pretty flowers during that walk as well. This is where Maru expressed that he feels like he was already out of Tokyo and I couldn’t agree more. It was still Tokyo but it was already a suburb. I liked the environment here and the weather is in full cooperation, not a single cloud in my sight.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Hello Cycling station and picked up our bicycles. Not that we needed to, all of them were almost identical, if not. I walked Maru through how it is done. Truth to be told, it is my first time using Hello Cycling. But because I’ve used Docomo before, I figured that the procedure would be the same. And it was.</p>

<p>We unlocked our bikes. As a short person, I needed to adjust the saddle and Maru helped me with it. This is how little my experience is—even adjusting the seat height would be needing assistance. On top of that, I tried unparking the bike by pushing the parking support (3) up but it would not budge. Maru explained that there is a lever on the left side of the bike and that I had to push it down first before I can raise the parking support bar (3). So that’s why I have to stay on the left of the bike when walking it, he said. Another fundamental thing I learned. Thanks, Maru.</p>

<p>We started riding and I was very nervous. Thanks to the few cycling practices I have done this month, I was less nervous than before but the degree of nervousness was still high. To help me regain my composure, I decided to listen to music via my true wireless earphones. I asked Maru if I could and he said sure, as long as it’s not too loud. Well, it did not matter anyway because I was only going to use one earbud. This scene reminded me of when I went skiing. I fear skiing as well as I have no control over it due to a lack of skills. I wore my earbuds and listened to uplifting music and my fear was effectively reduced by around 50%, allowing me to ski down the slope. Unluckily, my earbud fell and that anxiety relief was short-lived. Hopefully, this time, my earbud wouldn’t fall. I played Cold Heart and was grateful for the ease that music granted me.</p>

<p>Hello Cycling’s bicycle felt lighter than Docomo’s. Maru pointed out that the bike was well-maintained and I couldn’t agree more—it was such a smoother bike than my previously rented ones. At this point, I can say that the only reason why I haven’t used Hello Cycling before is the fact that I didn’t know about it. I was glad that Maru could have a good first experience with this.</p>

<p>We rode the bike through some actual roads before reaching the starting point of the cycling road. It was nerve-wracking to do but it was the only way to reach the starting point and also to learn. I wouldn’t learn unless I face my fears, I told myself. I kept on asking Maru for his patience and understanding of my poor skills but maybe I overdid it as he was very kind and understanding towards my inadequacies. Thank you, Maru.</p>

<p>After crossing a few roads here and there, we finally reached the starting point. What I can see was a long stretch of a road about half the width of the normal one for cars— too small for cars but more than enough for bikes. It’s an actual mini road for bicycles, cute, I thought. There were two lanes, one to go ahead and one to go back. There were plenty of people using the road: runners, joggers, walkers, you name it.</p>

<p>Because the road was a shared place, we could not go so fast. I had to be extra careful because I knew for a fact that I was still a clumsy rider. The last thing I would want to happen was to accidentally hit someone with my lack of control. I was more scared of hitting someone than injuring myself. The start was very slow due to my extra precaution, lack of confidence, and another reason that I found out only later on the ride, which I will mention further in this journal.</p>

<p>The road was full of metal barriers to slow the cyclists down, or “obstacles” as I prefer to call them. I can say that they are effective in slowing cyclists down, and they are exceptionally successful in doing so against me. While the average cyclist can pass through these obstacles with ease, the opposite could be said for me. My confidence was almost non-existent so squeezing myself into these small spaces was a tough effort. 90% of the time, if not all of the time, I had to get off my bike and walk through these obstacles due to my fear of cycling through narrow spaces (fear of bumping into things). I’m pretty sure Maru could have passed through these barriers with ease but he was patient enough to cycle behind me, to stop when I had to.</p>

<p>I loathed the obstacles because they were a hassle to our otherwise straight-line path. These barriers were not visible on the map and so I wasn’t expecting them at all, catching me off-balance (pun <em>intended</em>) Although I have this negative feeling towards them, I could see their importance in keeping the pedestrians safe, so I accepted the fact that they had to be there. I could complain all I wanted but they wouldn’t magically disappear so I just let it ride (pun <em>intended again</em>). That being said, I took the opportunity to see how these obstacles can actually be helpful to me instead of being against me. I realized because of the repeated action of stopping, getting off, walking, and riding again, I was subconsciously practicing those skills. I got used to stopping and riding in such a short time span. Everything can be turned into a learning experience, after all, whether it is positive or negative. All I’m sure of is that learning can’t possibly be a bad thing.</p>

<p>After a few kilometers of cycling, we passed by a train station, marking the first milestone of this cycling activity. Like most train stations, this one had several restaurants and shops scattered around it. I did not have the chance to use the washroom before starting the ride so I wanted to use the one in the supermarket. I mentioned it to Maru but I took it back, saying that I could still hold it in. I was thinking that I was already slowing Maru down by a lot so if I could just use the toilet at a later time, during an actually planned break, it wouldn’t be as bad. But Maru argued that I shouldn’t hold it back so I just agreed. There was a sign right outside the supermarket saying that parking bicycles weren’t allowed but Maru was gonna stay behind to look after my bike anyway so he waited outside. I tried to be as quick as I could but unfortunately, there was a queue in the ladies’ room, as usual. I felt relieved when I went back to Maru. I’m glad I followed him because I didn’t realize that holding it in was also adding to the mental stress that I had at the time.</p>

<p>We continued to ride and came across a very steep overpass for bikes and pedestrians. It intimidated me big time. At the time of writing this, I don’t remember exactly (4) but I think Maru told me that it is my chance to learn how to ride slopes. He guided me on how to adjust the assistance of our e-bikes. I increased the assistance and felt amazed by it, as I was able to ride over the overpass without much effort. I wasn’t confident about riding back down so did it very slowly, using my bike’s brake.</p>

<p>We cycled moving forward, encountering more obstacles. Sometimes, I felt confident and passed through them but most of the time, I was too close to bumping them. I told Maru, “I had to swallow my pride and walk (through the obstacles).</p>

<p>After a few minutes, we decided to stop by a small park for a short break. Since winter was only about to end, the park looked pretty dead. I ate my mandarin for a quick sugar boost. We chatted about growing old, looking at the two passersby whom we didn’t know if they were a couple.</p>

<p>We scheduled our next stopover as when we see the lake and continued to cycle. On the road, a white family passed by (this will be relevant later).</p>

<p>Maru explained about the bicycle gears. He told me to try switching it. As soon as I did, I felt a significant increase in efficiency with my cycling. I assumed later on that the prompt for this teaching was probably because he saw me struggling to pedal needlessly on the first gear. I’m not complaining, but rather grateful.</p>

<p>Shifting gears on my bike was just like driving, I thought, as I recall my manual driving memories. From that, I started associating riding a bike with driving. Look ahead, not down, brake slowly, shift gears appropriately, etc. After all, bicycles are just minimalistic cars, in my opinion. With these thoughts and cues, some part of my nervousness went away.</p>

<p>Continuing…</p>

<p>Upon stopping at yet another barrier, Maru exclaimed “did you make that guy fall?” I did not notice if I did, didn’t see nor hear anything. But I wouldn’t be surprised if I actually did. I felt sorry for whoever that guy was.</p>

<p>After a few more couple of obstacles, they’ve finally lessened to a point where I only encountered one or two every five minutes. Same story with the people using the cycling road. Now, this was a game-changer in my cycling experience. Maru and I arrived at the entrance to the park right beside the lake way earlier than we both anticipated. We took around half the time of the first half of the ride. I double-checked the map in disbelief but it was true.</p>

<p>The second half of the ride to this point was way quicker not only because of the fewer obstacles but also because I was starting to gain a bit of confidence, giving me a sense of control to just keep going on. After the hurricane, comes the rainbow, as Katy Perry said in her Fireworks song.</p>

<p>Long stretches of no obstacles or people, after the hurricane, comes a rainbow, as Katy Perry said in Fireworks. I definitely deserve some fireworks for reaching here, after all, I have already cycled 13 km up to this point. And for someone who couldn’t ride a bike for a 100m or so without panicking just a month or two before.</p>

<p>We paused and took a selfie to celebrate.</p>

<p>Because I had some energy left (and maybe Maru as well.) We agreed to “stop when we can stop,” meaning, if there is a place where we can park the bike, we will stop and take a break there. Maru assured me that I can stop anytime I felt like stopping and it was so kind of him.</p>

<p>We continued cycling and it went as smoothly as the second half. Though it felt a bit different because the elevation was way more variable than before.</p>

<p>We saw a park with some families playing around and decided to stop there. We parked the bicycle in the parking for the park (lol). I was afraid of our bikes being stolen because after all, we just rented them. But we tried locking it, and amazingly, we could. We just had to use the pin to unlock it whenever we want to continue.</p>

<p>It felt relieving to get off the bike after riding it for quite some time. This is also the time I realized that the hydration I brought with me was not enough, so I purchased another bottle from the vending machine beside the parking. Even though we were far from the city center, I was delighted at the fact that there is a vending machine here to quench my thirst. Japan truly is the land of vending machines.</p>

<p>We walked a bit to a gazebo in the park. It felt nice to be finally under the roof. I did not realize that my sun exposure was already probably too much. If I remember correctly, Maru also wanted to rest in a place under a shade. Thankfully the gazebo was empty.</p>

<p>Maru saw this charging port right beside the gazebo. We were so amazed. I’m gonna correct my sentence above, Japan is not only the land of vending machines, but Japan is THE land of convenience. I conveniently charged my phone here out in the boonies.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We sat down and ate the sandwiches that we brought from the train station. Hooray for recharging, both my phone and my body.</p>

<p>We strolled around the park after we ate our lunch. We saw a single blooming tree and of course, I took the chance to take a selfie there.</p>

<p>I observed there were plenty of fallen leaves that were piled up all over the park. It was so tempting to jump and fall on them just because they reminded me of Assassin’s Creed (if you know, you know). Sadly Assassin’s Creed is just a game and I’d probably hurt myself trying because of real-world physics.</p>

<p>The park consisted of some obstacle courses. If I were fully charged, I would have tried them all but because we were still far from our finish line, I decided to just preserve my energy. But one of the installations piqued my interest, it was the log climb, I climbed it. Maru kindly recorded me doing so. It was a fun experience, it made me feel like I was the badass Tomb Raider herself (although it was totally nothing compared to what she does lol).</p>

<p>Taking this break in the park not only recharged me physically but also mentally. I was already mentally fatigued by taking on this challenge, I expressed to Maru. He said it’s amazing that I can sustain a mentally challenging state for quite a while and I felt flattered.</p>

<p>We went back to the parking and thankfully our rented bikes were still there. We unlocked them and continued cycling. The fear of riding was still there but we went so much faster, all thanks to the break we had and the confidence which was slowly building up in me.</p>

<p>While riding, my left wrist started getting numb at times. I thought to myself that it was probably due to the mental stress that I had. Even though it was mental, it was getting reflected in my physical stress—my arms, and hands stiffened as a grasped the bicycle’s handle too tightly. Whenever I notice this, I tried to actively loosen up my grip a bit.</p>

<p>Continuing cycling along with the like, I saw the white family that I have mentioned above. They were already on their way back. Wow, we were still on the way and this family, with kids, we’re already on their way back, proved how slow we were due to how bad my cycling skills were, I laughed to myself. Not only that but there were also small kids who overtaken me easily. I wish I had their confidence in riding.</p>

<p>There were times when I was scared of losing control. And the song being played by my earphones from a random playlist having the lyrics of “I’m losing control” did not help at all. I was terrified of losing control and crashing. But I told myself, maybe I should be stoic about it… resisting death will only make it closer, I thought.</p>

<p>At times when I did not feel like I was out of control, it was actually a good feeling, especially when sliding down. And then I realized that I can finally go down the slope without being crazy scared about it, while staying put on the bicycle, with my foot attached to the pedal. I was not able to do this before, so I felt a bit proud of the small accomplishment.</p>

<p>We were already tired so we decided to wrap our ride up in the nearest Hello Cycling station from our current location. It was stationed beside a Buddhist temple. As soon as I got off my bike, I felt a huge relief. Walking felt amazing, mostly because of the fact that walking does not need mental strain, it does not need controlling, and falling is impossible because I am my body. It made me wonder, maybe cyclists feel like the bicycle is a part of their body, so they may feel in full control?</p>

<p>We were already there so we might as well check the temple out. We walked on the temple grounds and saw the bright red pagoda and a cave. Feeling adventurous, I invited Maru to go inside the cave. The inside was cool and windy, perfectly refreshing to me, after a quite long workout. We exited the cave and reached the backside of the pagoda.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We saw a staircase going down with some interesting architecture to it. It reminded me of the Chinese temple I went to as a kid in Baguio City.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There was a Kannon Statue pouring an endless stream of water onto a small pond. We also saw a temple surrounded by plenty of pinwheels. It reminded me of how my ex gave me a pinwheel annually when I was in university. It was a good memory so I shared that small detail of my life with Maru.</p>

<p>While checking out the nearest parking earlier, we actually saw that there was a “Totoro Forest” near our current location. I wanted to check it out, and luckily Maru was open to the idea. I let him navigate us. We went back up the dragon guarded staircase, only to find out that it was the wrong direction when we were already at the top. It was funny that we ended up going back down.</p>

<p>On the way, we saw this ring on the map and I was so curious about it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We walked near it and found out that the donut hole was actually a shrine, and the donut itself is a circular pond surrounding it, with some plants around it. Interesting, I thought.</p>

<p>Walking forward, we saw a sign that says thank you for visiting the temple, in Japanese. I explained it to Maru, thinking it was something good to know.</p>

<p>While strolling in the empty streets, I felt ecstatic, the same feeling as the runner’s high. I thought that maybe it was the endorphins we got from cycling for quite a long time.</p>

<p>We saw a huge dome.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I started talking to Maru about Strava, which is basically “Facebook for exercising”, I said. I also revealed my goal of cycling 100 kilometers in March to be able to learn how to ride it, and have some confidence in it.</p>

<p>We passed by a Family Mart and bought a rehydration supply. I realized that I have underestimated the hydration that I needed so I got a huge bottle of Sokenbicha. I drank a lot to rehydrate myself because I lost so much water from sweating.</p>

<p>Checking out Google Maps, I just found out that we were already in Saitama. I was thrilled by that fact and declared it to Maru. But he already knew. Apparently, he saw a sign that we were entering Saitama while we were cycling. I did not notice that sign at all because I was too focused on staying in control while cycling.</p>

<p>We reached Totoro’s Forest. According to Google, it is a popular summer hiking place. There were several spots that are numbered, Totoro Forest 1, Totoro Forest 2, etc. I did not understand it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/7.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Traversing to Totoro’s Forest was unexpected hiking. Maru’s pants did not seem easy to move with. Sorry, Maru, I thought. I took this moment to talk about my previous unexpected hike in Kamakura where I was wearing office clothes.</p>

<p>We took short breaks from walking and climbing and I sipped my <em>Sokenbicha</em>. I explained its kanji to Maru and why I like it—it’s refreshing爽, healthy健, and beautiful美 tea茶.</p>

<p>I also explained the concept of 森林浴 <em>Shinrinyoku</em> or forest bathing to Maru. I taught him the kanji and it was funny that there were a lot of tree components in the kanji.</p>

<p>As we walked through the forest, there were more and more insects around. I thought it was weird because winter just ended and it wasn’t that warm yet. We came across a signboard while walking and it said that we were in 虫たちの森 <em>mushitachi no mori</em>, meaning “forest of insects”. That made perfect sense.</p>

<p>We started hearing a trumpet sound while walking inside Totoro’s numerous forests. It was a good and relaxing background music that adds to the shinrinyoku experience.</p>

<p>We saw from another map that there was supposed to be a plum grove nearby. I was certain that they were already blooming because plums were already blooming everywhere in the Tokyo / Kanagawa area that I have been to. We walked to where we thought the plum trees were but we were not able to see them because we did not actually take note of the map that we saw…</p>

<p>Maru noticed the dead trees and said that those trees were already past their peak. I told him that was not the case as dead trees are not yet in bloom and it was the green trees that are past their peak.</p>

<p>We couldn’t find the plum grove so we headed toward the park right beside Sayamako (Lake Sayama). As we walked toward it, the trumpet sound was increasing in volume, indicating that we were nearing it. We arrived at the base of the lake. We had to climb a small hill so that we can see the lake itself. While climbing, Maru saw the trumpet player on the hill, he exclaimed “finally!” I thought the same thing.</p>

<p>We finally saw the lake and it was huge and breathtaking. Not only the lake view was splendid, but also the view facing the opposite direction of the lake.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Maru saw the soccer field in the view and mentioned that it was uncommon to see in Japan, as baseball fields were way more popular.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Along the lake, there was a long stretch of runway, and Maru said it feels like we were in the Great Wall of China. Both of us haven’t been there though. I even forgot about the existence of the Great Wall.</p>

<p>We walked to a resting area and ate snacks. Maru apparently bought two FamiChikis and shared one with me. As I bite into the juicy boneless fried chicken, I realized that I haven’t consumed this delightful treat in quite a while.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-12-cycling-lake-tama/10.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Maru opened up about his studies and I listened to his stories while enjoying our chicken.</p>

<p>The fatigue was already setting in so we started heading back to the station. The nearest station was Seibukyujo-Mae. It was such a wide station but it was so empty. The train that we were gonna onboard arrived so we secured our seats. The seats were well-cushioned, making them pretty squishy. I appreciated it a lot, and Maru more, because his butt has been hurting from riding the bike for a long time.</p>

<p>The train started operating and we were finally on our way home. I asked him when was the time he cycled the longest? He answered this trip is the longest one. Me too.</p>

<p>The sun was already setting while we were on the way home. It was a pretty view, I exclaimed. Maru said that I can appreciate small things. I loved what he said because I knew it is true. I think it’s because I write my diary every day, helping me be grateful for the smallest of things.</p>

<p>I thought that the sunset signified the end of the day and the end of our trip. It was such a nice trip to the suburb. I definitely wanted to do it again. I wanted to tell Maru but I hesitated, thinking I could say it when I was nearer to my stop. But Maru said it first, and I was happy to say it back.</p>

<p>I have reached where I needed to transfer trains so I said goodbye and expressed my gratitude to Maru.</p>

<p>After a few more trains and several more stations, I was able to get home. I unpacked and saw my last piece of mikan. Thank god, it didn’t become juice, I thought.</p>

<p>(1) I always feel iffy whenever I type <river_name>gawa River because "gawa" means river in Japanese so when I say Tamagawa River, in my head it goes like "Tama River River"</river_name></p>

<p>(2) that being said, while being understanding toward late people, I still strongly encourage people to strive to be on time because, in the end, it is their responsibility</p>

<p>(3) I don’t know what this is called and Googling bicycle parts did not help</p>

<p>(4) Writing a journal about an event is best done right after it because any longer than that, I start to forget details</p>

<hr />

<p>Acknowledgment</p>

<p>Maru: Thank you for your patience and for hanging out with me. I learned a lot from you and it was such a fun experience!</p>

<p>Dua Lipa &amp; Elton John: Thank you for your song Cold Heart. Because of your wonderful music, I was able to relieve some of the stress that came with my fear of falling from the bike</p>

<p>Hello Cycling: Thank you for enabling us to go on a cycling trip without owning our own bicycles.</p>
