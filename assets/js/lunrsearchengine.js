        "title": "Girls' Hike at Mt. Maku",
        "body": "2022/02/26 - I hiked with my girl friends in Mt. Maku for an early spring! StartI want to hike at least once a month so I searched on Google for hiking recommendations for early February. One of the Google Search results showed some hiking recommendations where you can do “hanami 花見,” the Japanese word for watching flowers. Because of that, I included “hanami” in my array of usual Google Search keywords: “hiking”, “day-trip”, “beginner,” plus “hanami”. This article came up in one of the first few results. 黄色にピンク色とりどり。低山お花見ハイクで、一足早く春の花を愛でに行こう！ I skimmed the article and thought that the flowers in the pictures were beautiful. My favorite color is pink so my choices were cherry blossoms, peach blossoms, or plum blossoms. It was not time for cherry and peach, so I went with plum blossoms. In the article, Mt. Maku in Yugawara town has one of the earliest viewing periods so I chose that. According to the article, the plum blossoms are ready for viewing starting early February to mid-March, which is just in time. At first, I scheduled the hike to be on the 12th of February, but due to a previous appointment, I rescheduled it to the next week. However, it rained that day so I ended up going on the 26th. The ParticipantsThis time, I invited two friends. Let me briefly introduce them. Lai: Lai from Malaysia came to Japan at the same time as me to work in the same company. She is one of my best friends in Japan whom I hiked with the most. Hina: Hina is one of my first few Japanese friends. We went to a badminton event last month and I thought that it was fun to be active with her and she told me that she likes hiking so I invited her to join. I am the organizer for this hike so it was my responsibility to introduce them to each other. I didn’t know the Japanese word for the person who introduces her friends to each other, so I asked my language partner during our language exchange before leaving for the hike. He said that I can use the word is “kanji 幹事. ” In other words, I am the “kanji” of this trip.  We took this selfie inside the train. I made a rough draft of the plan for the hike and sent it to both Hina and Lai via SNS. It looked like something like this:  Hey, I made a rough plan, lemme know what you think!  7:45 Depart from Kawasaki Station via the Tokyo-Ueno Line  7:45-9 Go to Yugawara Station  9~ Convenience store, toilet break, etc  9:30 Go to Mt. Maku via bus  10 Slowly start hiking  12 Do a lunch picnic somewhere in the mountain  14 Finish hiking Departure from Kawasaki StationThe three of us met in Kawasaki Station as planned. I introduced Lai and Hina to each other. Both of them speak fluently enough Japanese and English so it was fine since there is no language barrier. We departed using the Ueno-Tokyo Line. We chatted about several different topics and thought my two friends can get along with each other.  We were headed towards the direction of Mt. Fuji so we were able to see it huge.  The train line ran along the sea so we were able to see its beauty. Arrival at Yugawara Station As planned, we purchased picnic goods from the convenience store right in front of the station. We were all hungry so each one of us ate an onigiri (Japanese word for “rice ball”). According to Google Maps, we were supposed to use a bus to go towards Mt. Maku. However, the schedule written on the app was a bit different from the actual one. We figured it out because a lady was announcing the bus departures to Mt. Maku via a megaphone. There is probably a special schedule today as there is an ongoing event in Mt. Maku called the 梅の宴, or the banquet of the plum. While we were on the bus, I realized that I forgot a very important matter to ask my friends. “You don’t have hayfever, right?” Thankfully, both of them said no. I told myself that as an event planner/organizer, I should take into account this kind of detail. Next time I will try to bear in my mind. During the bus ride, I introduced the recently popular word game, Wordle, to Hina. I already exchanged Wordle results with Lai every day so there was no need to introduce it to her. I thought that because Hina is interested in English, she would enjoy Wordle. I explained the game rules to her and she started guessing the word of the day. If you’re interested in Wordle, you can play it here (I have Japanese readers, okay?) Wordle - A daily word game HikingThe bus arrived at Mt. Maku Park, which is located at the foot of the mountain. There was an entrance fee so we lined up and purchased the entrance ticket. The sign at the entrance says that the flowers were only 70% in bloom. Too bad, I thought. But I remembered that I was supposed to go here two weeks ago… and if I did, I probably wouldn’t haven’t seen a single flower, so I guess I could still call myself lucky.  We were greeted by the pink scenery as we entered the park. Because of the ongoing event, it was more crowded than I expected. There was a bazaar as well. We could have bought our picnic food there, but too bad we already had our convenience store food.  We approached the foot of the mountain and started hiking. The plum grove was beautiful. I smelled the sweet aroma of the plum blossoms. “Wow it smells so good,” I exclaimed to my friends. However, both of them said they did not smell anything. Ahem? As we continued walking, we warmed up, basking in the sweltering sunlight. Winter was about to end so it was starting to get warm, I thought. I stripped my warm layers one by one until I was just wearing my shirt. We continued walking by just following the path without looking at the map. As we proceeded, the plum trees got fewer and fewer. Huh, that’s strange, I thought, so I checked with my hiking app. “Oh, sh*t, we’re going clockwise” (re: the hiking course was circular and the guide stated that we should go counterclockwise. ) I apologized to my friends and asked them whether we should continue or go back. They said it was okay to continue so we did.  I saw this small shrine at the entrance of the forest. We entered a forest of just camphor trees and took another selfie.  Like I said earlier, it was quite warm today so it felt good to be under the cool shade of the forest. While hiking, Hina exclaimed “oh I have a Wordle guess” and I found it funny, good to know she’s enjoying the game I introduced to her. As we continued climbing the forest, the ground started getting muddy. It was slippery and dangerous so we had to be careful. After a few minutes of walking, I realized the reason for the muddiness. We began seeing splotches of thin ice on the ground. That’s when it clicked to me. I saw that this mountain was covered in snow a few days ago on Instagram. So all this mud is probably due to melted snow.  Sign for the mountain summit. We finally arrived at the top of the mountain. There were many people doing picnic, and we joined them. We set up the picnic mat that I prepared on top of the grass and sat on it. We enjoyed the food that we bought from the convenience store. We noticed that our shoes and pants were so dirty because of the muddy trail. While eating, Hina finally solved the Wordle of the day.  After eating, we enjoyed the view of Sagami Bay from the top of the mountain. It was nice.  We started going down the mountain and it was naturally easier because of gravity. We saw a huge boulder on the way down, and apparently, people use it for rock climbing. I got excited just by looking at it. Unfortunately, I was not able to try it because I didn’t prepare. Adventurous activities thrill me so I’ll definitely try this kind of rock climbing next time.  We walked for a bit and we finally arrived back at the plum grove. There were thousands of flowers and it was the definition of a pink forest. I took several pictures using the camera that I brought. Here are some of them.   Because there were thousands of them, the fragrance of the plum blossoms was so perceivable. Hina said she was finally able to smell it. The ambrosial fragrance made it seem like we were in paradise. Lai said she still could not smell it. I found it funny that she did not smell any plum blossom during the whole hike. Too bad, I thought. Going HomeWe used Tokyo-Ueno Line again to go home. We were fairly tired so it was a silent train ride. Overall, I thought that it was such a girly hike, and I love it. The mountain was not high, the hiking trail was friendly, and the scenery was so pink so it’s perfect for a girls’ day out, I thought. I had fun introducing my two friends to each other. "

        "title": "A Retreat to Kamakura",
        "body": "2022/01/28 - I went to Kamakura for a small retreat from my busy Tokyo life. The First DayThese few days, the things I need to do and the things I want to do piled up so my mind is so cluttered, making me feel blue. I knew I was gonna burn up anytime soon if I don’t take a break. I didn’t wanna burn out so, to re-organize my thoughts and refresh my mind, I applied for some of my paid leaves. This time, I decided to go to Kamakura, which I’ve already visited in the past. I usually want to visit places where I haven’t visited but let me tell you why I chose Kamakura. There are three main reasons. First, Kamakura’s location is not that far from where I live. It just takes an hour to go there. This trip is quite abrupt so I didn’t wanna spend much money so I decided to save on transportation expenses. Second, I chose Kamakura for its vibe. It seems to be a very peaceful place with plenty of temples. It being spiritual suits my current situation, I thought. I’m not a religious person but I like the idea of cleansing one’s soul. The third reason is that Kamakura is situated near the sea. I don’t see seas often so I wanted to go to one. I finally arrived at Kamakura. I kept my earphones away so I can keep my mind distraction-free After getting out of Kita-Kamakura station, I saw my first temple of the day, Engakuji. (By the way, “ji” or “tera” or “dera” means “temple” in Japanese. I feel iffy typing “Engakuji Temple” even though that’s probably the official(?) English translation, because it literally means Engaku-temple Temple) The entrance had a fee so I decided not to go in and just look from the outside.  I walked towards my next stopover, Kenchoji, following the signs.  The hiking course that I planned to take was inside Kenchoji so I had no choice but to enter it, even though it was paid. The temple ground was pretty vast. However, because it was a weekday, there were only very few people.   Following the map, I stumbled upon this remarkably long path. This scene feels like a gate to heaven.  I saw a few caves while walking. Although I wasn’t sure if I could enter them, they made me excited as they reminded me of my favorite game, Tomb Raider.  I was so intrigued by these statues. I didn’t know what they are but they remind me of angels from Christianity(?) because of their wings. Their whole composition made me feel like they were a mixture of Japan’s tradition and Western. Upon checking on Google, I found out that they were tengu, supernatural beings in Japanese folklore.  I arrived at the viewing deck of Hansobo, the heart of Kenchoji. If you look close, you can see the sea from afar. I like the fact that I was able to capture temples, forests, hills, and the sea all in one picture. Isn’t it amazing?  The entrance to the hiking course was somewhat blocked so I thought it was closed. Thankfully, the person from the temple shop called out to me and told me that only parts of the hiking trail were closed. Well, I planned to just do some parts of the trail and head to Kamakura station so I proceeded and she let me enter the trail. When I started climbing the hiking course, I saw Mt. Fuji’s iconic white top. The sky was not clear so that part looks like it was floating. Can you spot it? While I’m hiking, let me tell you why I enjoy it a lot. When I was still in grade school, I used to play Tomb Raider a lot. I wanted to be like the main character in the game, Lara Croft because she is so strong and adventurous. She often went outdoors to hike and camp, etc. I saw a fellow hiker. Japanese hikers are generally friendly so we greeted each other Konnichiwa! He told me that he can see Mt. Fuji from where he was standing. I already knew I could see Mt. Fuji but he convinced me to go to where he was standing. I went and realized what he was talking about. Mt. Fuji was placed directly on top of the rock, and it was such a good frame to capture.  Hiking thoughts:  While I was hiking, I started to take notice of the minute things again. For example, as the wind blew, I heard the sound of the rustling leaves. Noticing small details of nature like this made me feel the beauty of living in the world.  Hiking is free of distraction, that’s why I like it so much. Being in nature is an escape from the busyness of my city life. I feel refreshed by basking in the green forest. This is the feeling of Shinrin-yoku (a Japanese term for forest bathing). I started having doubts about why I chose to live in such a busy city like Tokyo when I prefer a more laid-back place.  I feel grateful living in Japan. First, it is very commuter-friendly. I can easily commute to places such as this without needing a car. Second, because it is not a tropical country, I can do physical activities like hiking without suffering from the heat.  Maybe I also like hiking because it makes me feel closer to death. One wrong step and I could fall and land somewhere inaccessible and no one may know it. So, it means that I could die without anyone knowing. However, I think that being close to death makes me value my life more because I am reminded that I am merely human and not an eternal being. So I want to cherish the time that I have when I’m still alive. It makes me question whether the things I’m doing now are fulfilling my life. Because I only have one life, and after all, I’m a “being towards death”.  Hiking also makes me feel like I’m in such a huge world because the scenery is so different from my everyday life. And this feeling of being a small entity in an enormous place, such as the world, is not something I feel in my daily life. Suddenly, all my problems and stressors feel so small and insignificant in this huge world. This thought comforts me.  I’ve also noticed that there are many older people in this hike. It’s just an amazing thing for me that Japanese elder people are still very strong and healthy that they can do hiking. I passed by this small climb with a rope. Even though it’s such a small thing, it excited me a little because it feels a bit more adventurous. It made me wish I could go to a more adventurous place.  I saw this lovely hiking couple. Because I wanted to just relax, and not think about navigating myself, I just followed them. Seeing them made me want to have a partner whom I can hike with, even as we grow old.  Towards the end, there were some bamboo groves.  After finishing my fairly short hiking course, I visited Kakuonji (temple) which is situated near the end of the trail.   While walking towards Kamakura station, I saw these yellow flowers in bloom, called Wintersweet (ろうばい). They look like yellow cherry blossoms.  Late Lunch: I was hungry when I finished the long hike and walk. As my holiday treat, I went to a fairly highly rated Japanese restaurant.  I ate this and it tasted good. Here are some other photos I took while walking around Kamakura.  Spring is about to come!  Even the statues are wearing a mask. Heading towards my lodging: My hostel is located in Hase Station, a few stations away from Kamakura station via the Enoden line. I arrived at my hostel and had a great chat with the friendly hostel owner, Hide-san. He had several recommendations for things to do or restaurants to eat at. And that includes going to Hasedera. I already went to some temples in the morning so I was hesitant to go to another one. However, I still went because I didn’t have anything to do anyway. Hasedera: After arriving at the temple grounds and spending a few minutes, I realized that I didn’t regret my decision to go. In the main hall, the Buddha is not the usual one. It’s gold and huge. I wanted to take a picture but sadly it was prohibited to take photos inside the main hall.  This is a statue of Amitabha, the Buddha of Limitless Light, in the hall beside the main hall. It is not as big as the main one, but still majestic nonetheless. I was also intrigued by the small statues surrounding one of the halls of Hasedera. Apparently, they are called Sentai Jizo, which means a thousand Jizo’s. According to the guide, Jizo is a Buddhist deity for protecting children and giving prosperity to one’s descendants.  I haven’t noticed but when I shared this photo to my friend, he noticed that each face was different from each other. Amazing! I arrived at the top of the temple grounds and approached the viewing deck.  I can see the town and the sea. It was such a spectacular view. While admiring it, I felt solitude too because there were no other people. I saw some plum blossoms in bloom.  Japanese gardens or temple grounds relaxed me because of wabi-sabi, a form of traditional Japanese beauty which accepts transience and imperfection. I like the concept because it eases my perfectionism, relieving the pressure on things to be perfect. That pressure is lifted as I walk through this garden.  I went to the east of the temple grounds and proceeded to this cave with a tori gate in front. Inside it was so solemn and I felt awe in this very spiritual place.  Few people were praying inside. The temple closed shortly after I exited the cave.  Dinner: After my visit to Hasedera, almost everything was closed, so I decided to go to the Izakaya (a Japanese bar) recommended by Hide-san called Shamoji.  I’m beside the sea, so it’s just natural for me to eat seafood. I ordered Misaki maguro (tuna) rice bowl with shirasu (whitebait) toppings. Eating this reminds me of the time I went to Misaki.  The fish was fresh as I expected. And I felt full from my rice bowl. So I decided to walk it off before heading back to my hotel. Without realizing it, I reached Kamakura station.  I walked so much today and I don’t want to arrive at my hotel too late at night, so instead of walking, I decided to take the Enoden line train to Hase station again. I arrived at my hotel quite tired. But, I maximized my day so I won’t complain. The Second DayI thought that since Kamakura is facing East, where the sun will rise, I wanted to see it for myself. I was picking where I want to greet the sun: at the top of a hike, or by the sea while running. I was already tired last night and I didn’t have the energy to look for a trail anymore, so I decided to just go for a run. I woke up around 5:30 am. I drank the free coffee provided by the hostel to energize myself for my run. I went outside when it was still dark and started running along the seaside. I loved the sound of the waves and the fresh air. I didn’t run seriously, as I was distracted by the beautiful view. I sometimes paused to take videos or photos, which I will dump on this article. The first stop was Inamuragasaki, a cape not so far from my hostel. I went down to the rocks beside the sea to get a closer view. The waves were roaring as they crashed upon the rocks. I even got showered a bit, which made me laugh. It was so fun yet so calming. I loved the feeling.  As I was running towards Enoshima, the sun finally peeked out, so I observed it and snapped a few pictures. The orange rising sun contrasts well with the blue sea. Its light was even reflected by the sea. I felt like I really am in Japan, as I am in the “land of the rising sun,” haha. The view (and the run) was breathtaking, and I felt so lucky to be able to witness a beautiful scene.  Here are some pictures from my run.  Enoshima from afar. I continued running and finally reached Enoshima Ohashi, a bridge towards Enoshima. I wasn’t intending to go to the actual island but I thought since I’m already here, might as well.  I ran from the entrance of Enoshima towards the back part, where the Iwaya Cave is. The island was almost empty because it was an early morning of a weekday.  I reached the distinct red bridge that leads towards the caves.  However, the cave doesn’t open until 9 am so I wasn’t able to go in. But it’s okay, I went there twice last year anyway. I ran back towards the nearest Enoden station and went back to my hostel to check out.  I started heading home. I was hungry so I stopped by Kamakura station for brunch. I ate at a cafe called Garden House. I liked its refreshing vibe. Because I was quite hungry, I ordered a salad to add to my open-faced chicken sandwich.  After that, I went back to Tokyo for real. The crowd increased as I neared Tokyo. When I finally get off my train, it was pretty crowded. I forgot for a while that Tokyo is a very populated place.  It pricked my heart a bit to be reminded of the busyness of city life. It made me think whether I would rather live in the suburb or provincial place, sacrificing convenience over laid-backness. As I arrived home, it felt like I was gone for a very long time. I think it means that I made full use of my two days one night holiday. I did many things, and I was alone. Being alone with my thoughts the whole time, helped me hear my intuition/my heart, which I probably neglected recently. That being said, I think my very cluttered brain came home more organized. In a sense, I fulfilled the purpose of taking a paid leave. "

        "body": "2022/01/26 - I experienced Japanese calligraphy (shodo) for the first time last Saturday. I like writing by hand but up until now, I haven’t held a real calligraphy brush so I was excited to join this workshop. Both my friend Yoshiki-san and I wanted to do a new year-ish activity so we thought it would be nice to do Kakizome, the Japanese term for the first writing of the year. Yoshiki-san kindly invited me to this workshop and he registered online for both of us. Workshop DayWe wanted to eat lunch together before the workshop so we met at Azabujuban Station around an hour before. We ate at a nearby cafe, with a pretty good vibe I liked. The matcha that I ordered tasted better than the one I make at home so I savored it well. As usual, it was fun chatting with Yoshiki-san. We walked a bit and we reached a place called エナジーテラスSunnyGo!. It had an art gallery in an underground room roughly as small as my apartment. Though it was small, the atmosphere was lively and colorful, making the cafe I visited earlier pales in comparison. That’s mostly because of the calligrapher’s vibrant art pieces hung all over the place.  The CalligrapherThe calligrapher’s name is Kisen Kuzuya. Based on what I saw in the art gallery, there’s no doubt that Kisen-san is highly-skilled and passionate about Japanese calligraphy (shodo). She said that apart from her main job at an IT company, she makes time to do shodo, explaining that it is not a “side job” but rather a “double job. ” (In Japanese, the word for side job is 副業 or fukugyo. Changing the first Kanji or Chinese character to 複, the meaning changes to “multiple jobs” while retaining the reading. Nice wordplay, right?) I was deeply moved by that explanation. Kisen-san knowing what she wants and actually doing it inspired me a lot. Shodo ExperienceAs I said above, I had no prior experience with shodo. So naturally, I was nervous at first. Thankfully, Kisen-san explained the process starting from the basic things, such as explaining the tools used for shodo, how to dip the brush, etc. It felt nice when I started writing. I fell in love with the feeling of painting the Kanji on the special calligraphy paper. It’s my first time so the character that I wrote was out of balance and kind of looked bad. Kisen-san kindly taught me how to improve it.  One example that I remember is when she taught me that one part of the word for “hope” needed to be curved and not straight as I wrote it to be. Although it was my first time, the creative part of my brain was definitely stimulated. I love the feeling of being creative. A Special PresentBefore the workshop ended, Kisen-san reminded us that the workshop admission that we had included a present from her. That is, a kanji which Kisen-san thinks represents the participant written by herself on a small card. When Kisen-san was about to write the kanji, all three of us gathered around her. At first, she chose to write the kanji for me first. We tried to guess what she was about to write. When she started writing, the room filled with our oohs and ahhs as we were amazed by her technique. The Kanji for me was “楽”, which can mean fun or ease. I enjoy my life, so I think it suits me well. And recently, I wanted to feel at ease, so it’s perfect. Yoshiki’s was was “繋”, meaning to connect. The reason is that Yoshiki-san often contacted Kisen-san before this event was held. We took a picture with Kisen-san, holding our presents.  Kisen’s kanji is truly a work of art. I couldn’t wait to decorate my home with this. Overall, I enjoyed experiencing Japanese culture such as shodo. Thanks to the calligrapher Kisen-san’s bubbly personality, we also felt cheerful. I learned many things about shodo, making me want to write more kanji characters in the future. "

        "title": "Spending my winter holidays in Nagano",
        "body": "2021/12/31 - I wanted to spend my holidays in a snowy place so I went to Nagano. The Day Before: I finished packing my pack the day before. My backpack was pretty big so I also slipped my whole camera bag inside it. I haven’t worn the white boots in the picture for two years already so I was excited as I was going to be able to wear them again on this trip.  In other words, I haven’t been to a snowy place for two years already. I checked the weather forecast to mentally prepare for that. It seems that it will be freezing so I was a bit nervous.  I will leave at 6 am the next day so I set my alarm to 5 am.  The First DayLet’s go! It was still dark but I wanted to make full use of the day so I decided to leave early.  First of all, I was going to meet with my company for this trip at Ueno Station’s Shinkansen (bullet train) platform.  Thoughts while commuting  I completely forgot, but today is a weekday! I shouldn’t have been surprised to be on such a packed train… Riding the Shinkansen from Ueno Station: I was finally able to meet with my friend. We wanted to buy tickets from the ticket sales machine but I used Mobile Suica (IC Card), I could not use it, for the machine only accepts the physical card. So, we ended up buying from the ticket office.  Introducing my Friend: Name: Bryan Lao Nickname: Bry Bry was my instructor for programming in my alma mater, Ateneo. He graduated as a PhD student in NAIST. He moved to Tokyo after that after that to work. Chat in the Shinkansen: Difference between Philippine and Japanese culture We both grew up in the Philippines and came to Japan in our 20s. We compared and discussed how it is different to live in the Philippines and Japan and the different points of view which both countries can be looked at. Trying out camera lenses Bry is a camera enthusiast so he owns several camera lenses. He lent me one to use with my mirrorless camera, explaining its capabilities and usage. Arriving at Nagano Station: Thanks to the Shinkansen, in just a few hours, we arrived at Nagano Station. It’s way colder here than in Tokyo.  I learned about Sugitama: While looking for a place to eat breakfast, Bry called out to me. He pointed to the green sphere hanging from the ceiling, explaining that it is called a Sugitama (“cedar ball”, indicating the maturity of sake. Green balls are freshly made sake, which develops into brown balls that are matured sake.  Breakfast at Kobeya Kitchen: I ordered a hot sandwich set. Traveling is no excuse not to eat veggies so I was glad that my order came with a side salad.  Heading towards Yudanaka Station: We can choose between riding a bus or a train but the bus makes me nauseous so we decided to take the train.  I was surprised that I could not use my Suica in this station. So, I bought from the ticket sales machine again (☉｡☉)! I thought it was strange that the train floor was wet. And then I realized that it was probably due to all the snow from the passengers’ shoes. I took this picture on my train transfer.  The views we had in our train ride were fields and mountains blanketed by thick snow.  Arriving at Our Hostel: Our room was a simple traditional Japanese-style room.  The outside view was also Japanese style.  Lunch: We ate Pork Char siu Ramen at a small Chinese diner behind our hostel. We planned to walk lots so eating something full of carbs was justly appropriate.  I got full from this! Jigokudani Monkey Park: After lunch, we headed towards Jigokudani Monkey Park, a park where you can see monkeys bathe in onsen (hot spring). We walked on a snow-covered mountain road. There was snow everywhere I looked and everything was so white and pretty.  The road was thickly covered with fresh snow so they were so soft to walk at. It was surprising that there was no one else here, despite being a tourist spot.  After walking for so long, we finally arrived at the park. The monkeys weren’t inside the onsen, but rather just sitting or walking around. Maybe because they can access the onsen anytime, they’re probably tired of it.  After a few minutes, finally one of them entered the onsen, delighting the visitors.  Apart from that, these two monkeys did something funny. Bry said that I was able to take the “perfect picture” lol We decided to walk back from the monkey park back to our hostel. The ramen I ate was already fully digested so I was hungry again. Luckily, there was a cafe halfway on the way home. The cafe’s lighting charmingly contrasts with the winter scenery so I decided to take this picture.  I ordered hot chocolate, which is perfect for winter, am I right? ( ꈍᴗꈍ)Because of the warmth that it gave me, I was able to conquer the cold snowy mountain on the way back! Yudanaka Onsen: The hostel we stayed at was affiliated with an onsen called Yorozuya, so we were able to purchase onsen tickets at a discounted price. We headed to the said onsen, which was just a 5-minute walk from our hostel.  Two words to describe Yorozuya’s interior were elegant and traditional. I love it.  I entered the rotenburo (“open-air hot spring bath”) and admired the snow surrounding it. It’s the second-best onsen experience I had (the first one was when it was actually snowing). My exhausted feet which I used the whole day was revitalized, thanks to the heat of the onsen. Entering the onsen is the best feeling for the tired. Bry was this happy.  Dinner at the Izakaya: It was already late we left the onsen so almost all of the restaurants were already closed. We ended up eating at an Izakaya (Japanese bar).  Bry has an alcohol allergy and I wanted to reduce my alcohol intake so both of us ordered soft drinks only at the Izakaya (lol). I thought it was funny when said cheers over our glasses of orange juice and soda.  We ate yakitori. It was so salty, so thank god I ordered orange juice to save my tongue lol I haven’t tried Yakionigiri (grilled rice ball) so I ordered it as well. I thought its brown color was because of using brown rice, making me amazed how such a healthy menu can be ordered in a bar. However, Bry said that it wasn’t brown rice, but rather due to soy sauce. Oops. (；^ω^） The Second DayOkushiga Kogen Ski Resort: We used this discounted red ticket to go to Okushiga Kogen Ski Resort by bus.  The snow-covered mountain is so pretty, right? This is the kind of view that I couldn’t see in Tokyo.  We bought ski lift tickets and rented some skis.   We rode the lift. Thankfully the weather was good ヽ(･ˇ∀ˇ･ゞ) We didn’t take ski school or class so we were naturally not good at it. I watched the other skiers and tried to copy them. I was very scared but I really wanted to try skiing. Once I got off the lift, there was no other way to go down but to ski. I tried to use my earphones to mask my fear. And it worked, the lively music alleviated my fear a bit, encouraging me to go down the slope. In fact, it excited me. However, I often lost my confidence. I was afraid to fall so I panicked a lot. Because of that panic, my body stiffened, making me end up falling. I can’t even count how many times I fell, I just knew it was too much. It was quite embarrassing because I’m so bad at it despite being on a beginner slope (^～^;)ゞ. But it’s okay, I assured myself. It’s only reasonable because everyone is a beginner at first. Anyway, my purpose for skiing was to have fun. To be fair, I had a lot of fun. Even falling several times was okay because the snow was very soft. But doing something you’re unfamiliar with is tiring, right? What I want to say is skiing fried my brain too (~_~メ) Heading towards Shibu Onsen: Using the same ticket, we went down the hill via bus.  Dinner: Walking a bit from the bus stop, we arrived at a restaurant called Happy Restaurant.  Finally, some real food here! (Btw, my breakfast was just yogurt and my lunch was just Calorie Mate, a Japanese brand energy bar). The tonkatsu (pork cutlet) set that I ordered was quite good.  Kanaguya: We visited Shibu Onsen’s Kanaguya on the way home. It is a historical Japanese inn that inspired Studio Ghibli’s Spirited Away, they say.  We started to walk back home from Shibu Onsen. Some snow was already half melted so it was very slippery. We threaded carefully. While walking, I saw this snow-covered post. Snow and posts are two things I like so I was glad to take this picture. The vivid red post has a beautiful contrast with the muted white snow, right? The Last DayWe checked out and headed to Yudanaka Station. From there, we took the train to go to Nagano Station. I wanted to kill time so I read a book.  It was lunchtime when we arrived. Bry wanted to eat Shinshu Soba so we ate at a standing soba restaurant at the station. I ordered soba with egg. Note that this was my first time eating at a standing restaurant (人 •͈ᴗ•͈) It was time for us to ride the bus that we reserved so we headed to the bus stop. We’re taking the bus on the way home because we wanted to save. But vacations are supposed to be enjoyed, so we didn’t want to cheap out too much. The good compromise would be taking the shinkansen on the way to, and the bus on the way back, we thought.  I read again inside the bus.  After that, I finished writing this report. Overall, these past three days have been a lovely way to spend my vacation. This is the longest time I’ve walked on snow. As a Filipino, I grew up in a tropical country where there isn’t snow so going to a snowy place such as Nagano made me glad. "
